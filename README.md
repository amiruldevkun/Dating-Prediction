# DATING PREDICTIONS (C# VERSION)
A dating prediction cli script to see if you have a chance with the person that catches your eye.

## Why did i make this?
Because i was bored and wanted to do something in my free time. Its not useful in anykind, but feel free to try it out i guess. It is not accurate by any chance, so if you value your integrity and don't want to embarrass your self, please step away. But, if you like being embarrased or just playing around, then go straight to the [building](https://github.com/amiruldevkun/Dating-Prediction#building) section. You could also contribute to this mess, I'll tell you later, read more of this. :point_down:


## How does this script works?

First, the code will try and determine your gender. Then, once it knows your gender it will assign the other gender to be the crush's gender

Secondly, it will take your age name and personality, the same goes for the crush. 

Lastly, it will try to match you together, by taking personality and age into consideration.

(stolen from this, my old [python](https://github.com/amiruldevkun/datingpredictions) repo)

# IMPORTANT

This program is currently __UNDER DEVELOPMENT__ so expect unfinished-ness and bugs. 
<!-- ## How to get the script
So, you decided to grab the script. Alright, first if you have git, do 
```
git clone https://github.com/amiruldevkun/datingprediction_updated
```

Then, wait until it has done cloning. After that, you will have to go to `bin/Debug/net5.0`, and run the exe file. You might need the (dot)net sdk to run it but im sure its fine. 

Another way to get the script is to use the **BIG** green button on the top called `CODE`. Click it and download the zip. Unzip the file and go to the file location, and run the exe file and boom, its running. 

Just keep in mind that this code is __UNPOLISHED__ , __UNFINISHED__ and __WILL__ have bugs. If thats the case, you can either contribute by git cloning and making a pull request or shoot me a dm through twitter cuz thats the only place i have dms open. -->

## BUILDING
Ok, so you have decided to not do it the easy way and wanted to build it yourself. So, these are the prerequisites.

- The [.NET sdk (Version 5)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor (Optional) 

After you have buckled up with the prerequisites that i have stated, click on the green button that says ' Code ', click download zip, unzip the file, open a command prompt in the folder and type 'dotnet clean' and then 'dotnet build'. And after you are done! Enjoy this unfinished mess! 

## CONTRIBUTING
If you want to contribute to this mess, make a pull request(s) __THAT IS NEEDED__ only as i dont want to waste my free time going through edgy and weird code pulls all day when i have school. 

Fork this repo if you want, but please refer back to this repo. Also becoz i dont have any explicit way to contribute but use common sense please. The dedicated file will be made for how to really contribute.

## HELP INQUIRES 
If you need help you can tag me on twitter or dm me, since i dont have anyone with perms to keep the repo going, i might not respond fast so keep that in mind.
