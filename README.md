# DATING PREDICTIONS (C# VERSION)
A dating prediction cli script to see if you have a chance with the person that catches your eye.

## Why did i make this?
Because i was bored and wanted to do something in my free time. Its not useful in anykind, but feel free to try it out i guess. Its not accurate by any chance, so if you value your integrity and don't want to embarrass your self, please step away. But, if you want to contribute, you can! I'll tell you later, read more of this. :point_down:


## How does this script works?

First, the code will try and determine your gender. Then, once it knows your gender it will assign the other gender to be the crush's gender

Secondly, it will take your age name and personality, the same goes for the crush. 

Lastly, it will try to match you together, by taking personality and age into consideration.

(stolen from this my old python repo [python](https://github.com/amiruldevkun/datingpredictions))

## How to get the script
So, you decided to grab the script. Alright, first if you have git, do 
```
git clone https://github.com/amiruldevkun/datingprediction_updated
```

Then, wait until it has done cloning. After that, you will have to go to `bin/Debug/net5.0`, and run the exe file. You might need the (dot)net sdk to run it but im sure its fine. 

Another way to get the script is to use the **BIG** green button on the top called `CODE`. Click it and download the zip. Unzip the file and go to the file location, and run the exe file and boom, its running. 

Just keep in mind that this code is __UNPOLISHED__ and __WILL__ have bugs. If thats the case, shoot me a dm through twitter cuz thats the only place i have dms open.

## BUILDING
Ok, so you have decided to not do it the easy way and wanted to build it yourself. So, these are the prerequisites.

- The [.NET sdk (Version 5)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
- A text editor just in case
- Git 

After you have buckled up with the prerequisites that i have stated, open the command line, and clone this repo anywhere reachable. Then, open or change directory in your cmd and type `dotnet build` and let it build. After that, go to `bin/Debug/net5.0` and run the exe file. And your done! 

## CONTRIBUTING
If you want to contribute to this mess, make a pull request(s) __THAT IS NEEDED__ only as i dont want to waste my free time going through edgy and weird code pulls all day when i have school. 

Fork this repo if you want, but please point back to this repo. I will put your name in the script to show the people contributed to this cli script. Also becoz i dont have any explicit way to contribute but use common sense please. The dedicated file will be made.

## HELP INQUIRES 
If you need help you can tag me on twitter or dm me, since i dont have anyone with perms to keep the repo going, i might not respond fast so keep that in mind.
